      <strong>üß¨ Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) Transformation</strong>
      - Leading multiple services with the main objective of transforming our
      clients' SDLC into Secure SDLC. These transformations included processes
      such as static code analysis, defect management, SCA, among others,
      ensuring the highest accuracy by customizing the involved tools. During
      the execution of these services, different security and integration
      processes were automated and encapsulated in microservices, allowing for
      scaling and evolution as needed. Other relevant activities performed
      during these services include technical benchmarking of tools, automation
      and execution of migration processes, operation of code review services,
      among others.
