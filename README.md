## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Hugo and Clone the Repository

Make sure you have `Hugo` package installed. Check `https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/`. For Debian distributions:

```bash
sudo apt install hugo
```

If you rather have it all dockerized pull the hugo image and work from there:

```bash
docker pull klakegg/hugo
```
To start, you need to clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/code-triarii/code-triarii.github.io.git
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the Content

Navigate to the `/content` folder and make your desired changes.

```bash
cd code-triarii.github.io/content
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please, do not modify `/themes/terminal` folder if you are unsure of what you are doing.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test it Locally
Before deploying, you should always test your changes. Run the Hugo server using the following command:


```bash
hugo serve
```

Visit `localhost:1313` in your browser to see the live changes.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Site
Build your site and make sure the docs folder gets updated.

```bash
hugo
```
Check if the docs folder has been changed using:

```bash
git status
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Commit & Push Changes

Once you're satisfied with your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
git push origin master
```
Wait for GitHub Actions to deploy the page.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Visit the Site
Your changes should now be live (it needs a little bit of time to get everything running correctly). Visit `code-triarii.github.io` to see them.
